Automated Authorship Obfuscation Detection
Authorship attributionaims to identify the au-thor  of  a  text  based  on  stylometric  analysis.Authorship  obfuscation,  on  the  other  hand,aims to protect against authorship attributionby modifying a textâ€™s style.  In this paper, weevaluate the stealthiness of state-of-the-art au-thorship obfuscation approaches using neurallanguage models in an adversarial setting.  Anobfuscator isstealthyto the extent that an ad-versary finds it challenging to detect whetherits output document is original or not - a deci-sion that is key to an adversary.  We show thatthe leading authorship obfuscation approachesare not stealthy as the output documents can beidentified with average F1 score of 0.871. Thereason for this weakness is that the obfusca-tors degrade text smoothness in a predictable,i.e., detectable manner.  Our results highlightthe need to develop stealthy authorship obfus-cation approaches that better protect an authorseeking anonymity.

## Getting Started

The following instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To run this project you should have a disk space of 17GB and python 3 installed.

### Installing

Following are the steps you need to follow to successfully run this.

First clone this repo

```
git clone https://github.com/asad1996172/Obfuscation-Detection
```

Then install all required libraries

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Then download pre-trained models and GPT-2 345M model and put them in the working directory. These folders go by the name 'models' and 'output' 

To download models, use the following link
```
https://www.dropbox.com/s/nikke8387y9smtp/models.zip?dl=0
```

To download output, use the following link
```
https://www.dropbox.com/s/5gputd5v1apfjkb/output.zip?dl=0
```

## Running the tool

In order to run the tool, simply run the following command

```
python3 app.py
```
